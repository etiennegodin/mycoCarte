- [ ]Gather Occurence Data 
	- Inaturalist request for all observations
	- Do not discriminate by verified for now, getting all possible repartition and also at genus level 
	- Keep only relevant columns and remove observations duplocates or without coordinates 
- [ ]  Spatial thinning occurences
- [ ] Classify occurence by time
	- [ ] Determine min max dates 
- [ ] Select spatial resolution 
- [ ] Select Predictors in GEE
- [ ] Preprocess predictors from foretOuverte
- [ ]Pseudo absence point generation 
- [ ] Bias predictors enginering
